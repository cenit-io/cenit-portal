Third-party applications and web services that consume feeds can leverage this data to provide feed awareness statistics to potential subscribers. FeedBurner captures traffic data at an overall level for every feed. Feeds that have item-level tracking enabled have access to much more detailed data at the individual item level. This data includes ""resyndication"" information, which is very useful for determining where and how a feed is being consumed. The FeedBurner Management API allows publishers of FeedBurner feeds to create and manage feeds within their FeedBurner accounts. Currently, the Feed Management API is offered only to Google partners who were previously under contract with FeedBurner.
