              Now we are close to celebrate our first anniversary next Jun 1st. At that time, there have been 
              hard work, long hours of brainstorming and lots of valuable feedback from colleagues. Most of which added 
              some new functionality or fine-tuned some existing functionality at CenitSaaS. We've got a recap of our work 
              that want to share with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              As my co-founder Cesar and I tend to do, we found ourself chatting ideas back and forth during a hard work week in May 2014. And thus the original idea for Cenit was born, a new proposal to integrate and exchange business data for a complete operational back-office automation using open source, social and community friendly approach.
            </p>

              A common story for companies is the blending of solutions around its core business value. Features developed by them, third-party's adaptations and others SaaS to facilitate operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once grown enough a new expansion requires a huge integration effort. But available integration solutions are heavy process. Some of them also need B2B transactions using complex EDI standards required for large companies and business sectors. These facts overkill many companies that can't overcome those challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most difficult thing during this time was try to find the right abstractions. A design that provides powerful yet simple abstractions, making this complex problem tractable.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “TO HAVE POWERFUL ENOUGH ABSTRACTIONS (THE RIGHT ONES) TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MODEL YOUR PATH TO PRODUCTION 
                EFFECTIVELY AND, IMPORTANTLY, REMODEL IT AS YOU LEARN AND EVOLVE IT OVER TIME WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, RESIST 
                THE TEMPTATION TO CONTINUOUSLY INTRODUCE NEW, UNNECESSARY ABSTRACTIONS THAT ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS MORE 
                DIFFICULT IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE THEY WILL BE LEAKY”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              But now all is more easy, we are working as a passioned team that believe in sharing what we learn and love challenges.
