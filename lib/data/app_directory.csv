Currently the library contains three APIs: The FeedFlare API allows anyone to develop new FeedFlare units that tag, share, and interact with syndicated content, wherever it goes. Using FlareAPI to create new units can be as simple as displaying a link to related content, or as powerful as incorporating another web service. The FeedBurner Awareness API allows publishers of FeedBurner feeds to reuse the detailed traffic statistics captured for any of their feeds. Third-party applications and web services that consume feeds can leverage this data to provide feed awareness statistics to potential subscribers. FeedBurner captures traffic data at an overall level for every feed. Feeds that have item-level tracking enabled have access to much more detailed data at the individual item level. This data includes ""resyndication"" information, which is very useful for determining where and how a feed is being consumed. The FeedBurner Management API allows publishers of FeedBurner feeds to create and manage feeds within their FeedBurner accounts. Currently, the Feed Management API is offered only to Google partners who were previously under contract with FeedBurner.
